<p>Hard hats are your first line of defense against falling objects, bumping into fixed objects, and electrical hazards. In mining operations, the risk of head injuries is significant.</p>

<h3>Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Inspect your hard hat daily for cracks, dents, or damage</li>
<li>Replace your hard hat every 5 years or after any impact</li>
<li>Never modify or drill holes in your hard hat</li>
<li>Wear the hard hat with the brim facing forward</li>
<li>Adjust the suspension system for a snug fit</li>
</ul>

<h3>When to Replace Your Hard Hat:</h3>
<p>Replace immediately if you notice any cracks, deep scratches, or if the shell becomes brittle. UV exposure can degrade the plastic over time.</p>`,

<li>Wear light-colored, loose-fitting clothing</li>
<li>Take breaks in shaded or air-conditioned areas</li>
